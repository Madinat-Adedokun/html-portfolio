<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  <br>With a robust background in nursing, I have dedicated several years to providing compassionate care <br>
  and support to patients in various healthcare settings. My experience has honed my skills in communication, <br>
  problem-solving, and teamwork, all of which are essential in both nursing and any collaborative environment.
</p>
<p>Recently, I embarked on a new journey into the world of web development, where I discovered a profound passion for <br>
  creating digital solutions that enhance user experiences. Through self-directed learning and hands-on projects, <br>
  I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages, design principles, and problem-solving techniques.<br>
  This exciting transition has not only expanded my skill set but has also invigorated my professional aspirations.</p>
  <p>
    As a mother of two, I understand the importance of balance and adaptability. My family inspires me to <br>
    strive for continuous growth, both personally and professionally. I cherish opportunities to travel, <br>
    as they enrich my perspective and creativity, allowing me to bring fresh ideas into my work.</p>
    <p>
      I am excited to merge my nursing expertise with my newfound love for web development, contributing <br>
      to projects that make a meaningful impact. I look forward to collaborating with others <br>
      who share my enthusiasm for innovation and creativity in technology.</p>
